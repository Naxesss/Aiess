# Aiess
Aiess is a web scraper which gathers and stores event data from the [osu! website](https://osu.ppy.sh). This mainly concerns events related to the [beatmap ranking procedure](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure), such as suggestions, nominations, and disqualifications. The purpose of Aiess is to grant third-party access to this flow of information, allowing for webhook feeds, statistical analysis, and performance evaluations.

### Note
This is a work in progress and soon-to-be upgraded version of the currently deployed, but closed source, version of Aiess. On top of aiming to provide additional feeds for discussions and replies, the version developed here is made in python, as opposed to the original C#/.NET Core. The swap is mainly due to my curiousity and desire to learn more about python.
